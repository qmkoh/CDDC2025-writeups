# CDDC2025-writeups

During the training period, there was a range of beginner level challenges to intermediate ones. Nevertheless, the competition was around intermediate level as well. Most documentation here are only for the challenges completed during the training period as I did not have time to emulate the challenges and re-evaluate my methods during the actual competition and had no access to the challenges after. Participated in this individually and emerged Top 5% overall during the training period.
